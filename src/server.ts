## PREREQUISITE: CHECK IF FILES ALREADY EXIST
${!force_regenerate ? `
IMPORTANT: Before generating new files, FIRST check if steering documents already exist:
1. **USE Read tool** to check if file exists: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
2. **USE Read tool** to check if file exists: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
3. **USE Read tool** to check if file exists: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md

If ALL THREE files already exist:
- STOP HERE and return: "‚úÖ Steering documents already exist at ${project_path}/.spec/steering/. No regeneration needed. Use force_regenerate=true to regenerate."
- Do NOT proceed with generation

If ANY files are missing, proceed with generation below.
` : 'FORCE REGENERATE MODE: Regenerating all steering documents even if they exist.'}

You MUST create THREE separate steering documents that match exact structure and content approach.

## üî¥ CRITICAL: YOU MUST CREATE THE FILES - NOT JUST REPORT SUCCESS
### File Creation Instructions:
1. **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/steering/
2. **USE Write tool** to create THREE separate files with exact filenames:
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md
3. **USE Read tool** to verify each file exists after creation

‚ö†Ô∏è The files MUST be physically created on the filesystem. Do NOT proceed without using the Write tool.

## üî¥ EXECUTION STEPS - YOU MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. Analyze the codebase at: ${project_path} using Read, Grep, and Glob tools
   - **IMPORTANT**: Check package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt, *.csproj, Makefile, etc.
   - Extract actual build/test/lint commands from these files
   - Look for CI configuration files (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.)
2. **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/steering/
3. **USE Write tool** to create product.md with product overview and business context
4. **USE Write tool** to create tech.md with comprehensive technology stack analysis
   - **CRITICAL**: In the "Build and Test Commands" section, document ACTUAL commands found in the project
   - Do not use placeholder text like "[e.g., npm test]" - use the real commands from package.json scripts or build files
5. **USE Write tool** to create structure.md with detailed project organization
6. **USE Read tool** to verify all three files exist and contain expected content:
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:

## PREREQUISITE CHECK
1. **USE Read tool** to check if ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md exists
2. If it doesn't exist, STOP and return: "‚ùå No tasks.md found. This tool is for implementing existing tasks only. Use generate-tasks tool first."
3. If tasks.md exists, proceed with orchestration below

## CRITICAL: This tool IMPLEMENTS existing tasks
- DO NOT generate new steering documents, plans, or task lists
- ONLY coordinate execution of tasks already defined in tasks.md
- Focus on dependencies and parallelization of existing tasks

## SIMPLICITY PRINCIPLES
1. Start with minimal viable tasks
2. Avoid over-engineering test requirements
3. Only include necessary sections per task
4. Focus on implementation, not process
5. Prefer iterative improvements over perfection

## CRITICAL: THIS IS A COORDINATION TOOL
This tool analyzes the task queue and creates an execution strategy. It does NOT execute tasks directly.

## PHASE 1: TASK QUEUE ANALYSIS
1. Read the tasks file: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
2. Parse all tasks and their current status:
   - ‚ö™ Not Started - Available for execution
   - üü° In Progress - Currently being worked on
   - ‚úÖ Done - Completed tasks

## PHASE 2: DEPENDENCY GRAPH CONSTRUCTION
Analyze the "Task Phases and Dependencies" section to understand:
- Which tasks block others
- Which tasks can run in parallel
- Critical path identification
- Phase groupings

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Identify Executable Tasks
Find all tasks that meet these criteria:
- Status: ‚ö™ Not Started
- All dependencies (if any) are ‚úÖ Done
- Not blocked by üü° In Progress tasks

### Parallelization Analysis
Group tasks that can be executed simultaneously:
- Independent tasks with no shared dependencies
- Tasks in the same phase that don't conflict

### Execution Order Analysis
Determine optimal sequential order based on:
- Dependency requirements
- Priority levels
- Phase progression

## PHASE 4: EXECUTOR DEPLOYMENT PLAN

For each executable task or task group, prepare deployment instructions:

### Tasks That Can Run Simultaneously:
**Group 1**: Independent tasks
- Task T-X: [Brief description]
  - Dependencies satisfied: [List completed dependencies]
  - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
- Task T-Y: [Brief description]
  - Dependencies satisfied: [List]
  - Priority: [Level]

### Recommended Execution Order:
1. **Immediate Execution** (no dependencies):
   - T-X: [Task title] - Ready to start
   - T-Y: [Task title] - Ready to start

2. **Next Wave** (will be unblocked after current tasks):
   - T-Z: [Task title] - Waiting for T-X
   - T-W: [Task title] - Waiting for T-Y

3. **Future Tasks** (multiple dependencies):
   - [List tasks that need multiple completions]

## PHASE 5: EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Deployment Options

**Option 1: Deploy Multiple Executors** (for independent tasks)
\`\`\`
1. Deploy task-executor for Task T-X with focus on [specific requirement]
2. Deploy task-executor for Task T-Y with focus on [specific requirement]
3. Monitor progress and reassess after completion
\`\`\`

**Option 2: Sequential Execution** (for dependent tasks)
\`\`\`
1. Execute Task T-X first (foundational)
2. Upon completion, verify and proceed to T-Y
3. Continue with dependency order
\`\`\`

### Progress Monitoring Strategy
- Check task status updates regularly
- When a task reports completion, run task-checker to verify
- Deploy new executors for newly unblocked tasks
- Handle any blockers or failures

### Task Verification Process
When a task is marked as üü° In Progress with all checkboxes checked:
1. Run task-checker tool to verify completion
2. If PASS: Update status to ‚úÖ Done
3. If FAIL: Keep as üü° In Progress and fix issues

## PHASE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT

### Potential Bottlenecks:
- Tasks with many dependents that could block progress
- High-complexity tasks that might take longer
- External dependencies that could cause delays

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Prioritize bottleneck tasks
- Prepare fallback plans for risky tasks
- Consider partial implementations for large tasks

## OUTPUT SUMMARY

**Tasks Ready for Execution**: [Count and list]
**Tasks Blocked**: [Count and list with blockers]
**Tasks Completed**: [Count]
**Parallelizable Tasks**: [List of tasks that can run simultaneously]
**Critical Path**: [Sequence of tasks that determine minimum completion time]

## NEXT STEPS
1. Review the execution plan above
2. Deploy task-executor tool for each ready task
3. Use task-checker tool to verify task completion
4. Re-run orchestrator when tasks complete to identify newly available work

Note: This orchestrator provides strategic coordination. Actual implementation happens through the task-executor tool, and verification through the task-checker tool.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: YOU MUST NOW USE SPEC MCP TOOLS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT**: The instructions above are analysis only. You MUST now ACTUALLY CALL the Spec MCP tools to implement tasks!

### üî¥ REQUIRED ACTIONS - USE THESE SPEC MCP TOOLS NOW:

Based on the analysis above, you MUST immediately:

1. **For EACH ready task identified above**, CALL the Spec MCP \`task-executor\` tool:
   \`\`\`
   USE Spec MCP tool: task-executor
   Parameters:
   - task_id: "[Task ID from above, e.g., T-1]"
   - project_path: "${project_path}"
   \`\`\`

2. **After implementing each task**, CALL the Spec MCP \`task-checker\` tool:
   \`\`\`
   USE Spec MCP tool: task-checker
   Parameters:
   - task_id: "[Same Task ID]"
   - project_path: "${project_path}"
   \`\`\`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT JUST READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è
**You MUST actually CALL/INVOKE/USE the Spec MCP tools mentioned above!**

These are NOT suggestions - they are REQUIRED tool calls you must make NOW.

**Clarification**:
- These are Spec MCP tools (external MCP server tools)
- NOT internal VSCode TODO tools
- Task status is tracked in tasks.md file
- You MUST invoke these tools through the Spec MCP interface

**Example of what you should do next:**
"I will now call the Spec MCP task-executor tool for task T-1..."
[Then ACTUALLY call the tool]`;

      content: [{
        type: "text",

    }
  },
  async ({ task_id, project_path = '.', update_status = true }) => {
    const prompt = `# Task Execution Guide for ${task_id}

## SIMPLICITY PRINCIPLES
1. Start with minimal viable tasks
2. Avoid over-engineering test requirements
3. Only include necessary sections per task
4. Focus on implementation, not process
5. Prefer iterative improvements over perfection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: TASK COMPLETION RULES
**DO NOT MARK TASK AS DONE UNLESS:**
1. ALL acceptance criteria checkboxes are marked \`[x]\` (not \`[ ]\`)
2. You have verified each checkbox is actually checked in tasks.md
3. Run task-checker tool FIRST to confirm all criteria are met
4. If ANY checkbox remains \`[ ]\`, keep status as "üü° In Progress"
5. Count and report: "Checked X of Y acceptance criteria"

## PHASE 1: TASK RETRIEVAL
1. Read the tasks file: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
2. Locate Task ${task_id} and extract:
   - Current status (should be ‚ö™ Not Started or üü° In Progress)
   - Requirements and traceability links
   - Acceptance criteria (EARS format)
   - Implementation details
   - Dependencies
   - Testing requirements

## PHASE 2: PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS

### Dependency Verification
Check that all tasks listed in "Blocked By" are marked as ‚úÖ Done.
If any dependencies are not complete, STOP and report the blockage.

### Context Gathering
1. Read steering documents if they exist:
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md for technology standards
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md for file organization
2. Read the tasks document: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
   - Use the Requirements section (R-X) and task details as the source of truth

${update_status ? `
## PHASE 3: STATUS UPDATE - MARK AS IN PROGRESS
Update the task status from ‚ö™ to üü°:
\`\`\`
Edit ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
Change: **Status**: ‚ö™ Not Started
To: **Status**: üü° In Progress
\`\`\`
` : ''}

## PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Files to Create
From the "Files to Create" section of the task:
1. For each new file listed:
   - Create the file at the specified path
   - Implement according to the code patterns provided
   - Follow the project's coding conventions

### Files to Modify
From the "Files to Modify" section:
1. For each existing file:
   - Read the current content first
   - Make the specified modifications
   - Preserve existing functionality
   - Follow existing code patterns

### Code Implementation
Using the "Code Patterns and Examples" section:
1. Implement the interfaces/types exactly as specified
2. Follow the function signatures provided
3. Add proper error handling
4. Include necessary imports
5. Maintain consistency with existing code

## PHASE 5: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IMPLEMENTATION

For each acceptance criterion in EARS format:
- WHEN [condition] THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]

Ensure your implementation:
1. Handles the specified condition
2. Produces the expected behavior
3. Includes error cases mentioned
4. Meets performance requirements
5. Satisfies security requirements

### Implementation Checklist:
‚ñ° All required files created
‚ñ° All required files modified
‚ñ° Each acceptance criterion has corresponding code
‚ñ° Error handling implemented

- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages, fallback UI, retry logic
- **Logging**: Add debug info, error tracking, user action tracking

### Best Practices:
1. Follow existing code patterns in the project
2. Use existing utilities and helper functions
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions
4. Follow the project's typing conventions or type-safety practices
5. Keep functions small and focused
6. Write self-documenting code

${update_status ? `
## PHASE 9: TASK COMPLETION
Once implementation is complete and tested:

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL VERIFICATION BEFORE MARKING DONE:**
1. First, verify ALL checkboxes are checked:
   - Count total acceptance criteria
   - Ensure EVERY single one shows \`- [x]\` (not \`- [ ]\`)
   - If ANY remain unchecked, DO NOT mark as Done

2. Update task status to Done ONLY if ALL checkboxes are \`[x]\`:
\`\`\`
Edit ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
Change: **Status**: üü° In Progress
To: **Status**: ‚úÖ Done
\`\`\`

3. Check all acceptance criteria checkboxes:
\`\`\`
Change: - [ ] [Criterion]
To: - [x] [Criterion]
\`\`\`

**RULE: Status can be "Done" ONLY when 100% of checkboxes show \`[x]\`**
` : ''}

## PHASE 10: POST-EXECUTION

### Verify Completion:
1. **ALL acceptance criteria checkboxes marked \`[x]\` (MANDATORY)**
2. All acceptance criteria met
3. All tests passing
4. No compilation errors
5. No linting errors (or only acceptable warnings)
6. Build succeeds
7. Manual testing complete

**‚ö†Ô∏è If any checkbox is \`[ ]\`, task is NOT complete regardless of other factors**

### Document Any Issues:
If you encountered any problems or made significant decisions:
1. Note them in the task's Implementation Notes section
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Create follow-up tasks if necessary

### Next Steps:
1. Run task-checker tool to confirm task is complete
2. Check for newly unblocked tasks
3. Run task-orchestrator to identify next tasks

## EXECUTION SUMMARY

**Task**: ${task_id}
**Objective**: [Extract from task description]
**Key Requirements**: [List from acceptance criteria]
**Implementation Approach**: [Your planned approach]
**Testing Strategy**: [How you'll verify correctness]
**Risk Factors**: [Any concerns or blockers]

Remember: Focus on completing this ONE task thoroughly before moving to the next. Quality over quantity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: THIS IS A SPEC MCP TOOL INSTRUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU ARE NOW READING INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SPEC MCP \`task-executor\` TOOL**

This tool has provided you with implementation guidance for Task ${task_id}.

**What you MUST do now:**
1. **IMPLEMENT** the task following the phases above
2. **UPDATE** the task status in ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md file (NOT internal TODO list)
3. **CHECK** acceptance criteria boxes as you complete them
4. **VERIFY** with Spec MCP \`task-checker\` tool when done

**Clarification:**
- Task status is tracked in the tasks.md FILE (not VSCode's internal TODO system)
- Update status by EDITING the tasks.md file directly
- After implementation, CALL the Spec MCP \`task-checker\` tool to verify

**DO NOT** just read these instructions - **ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT** the task now!`;

    inputSchema: {
      task_id: z.string().describe("Task ID to check (e.g., T-1, T-2)"),
      project_path: z.string().optional().describe("Path to project (defaults to current directory)")
    }
  },
  async ({ task_id, project_path = '.' }) => {
    const prompt = `# Verify Task ${task_id} Completion (Prompt-Only)

Goal: Decide if Task ${task_id} can be marked Done based on acceptance criteria checkboxes.

What to verify
- All acceptance criteria checkboxes for Task ${task_id} are marked "- [x]".

How to verify (evidence required)
1) Locate the tasks file:
   - Prefer: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
   - Else: any tasks*.md that contains "Task ${task_id}"
2) Find the Task ${task_id} block and its Acceptance Criteria section (or the closest equivalent for that task).
3) Count only lines that exactly start with:
   - Checked: "- [x]"
   - Unchecked: "- [ ]"
4) Quote the exact lines you counted and include path:line references.

Decision rule
- PASS: total > 0 AND unchecked == 0
- FAIL: if any unchecked > 0, or if none found, or if task/section cannot be unambiguously identified (Unverifiable)

Output format
- File: <path>
- Quoted lines: (the lines counted with path:line)
- Counts: Checked X/Y
- Decision: PASS or FAIL
- Reason: short explanation

Notes
- Do not run builds/tests here. When needed, use commands from .spec/steering/tech.md (Essential Commands).
- Do not modify any files.`;
