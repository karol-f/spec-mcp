## PREREQUISITE: CHECK IF FILES ALREADY EXIST
${!force_regenerate ? `
IMPORTANT: Before generating new files, FIRST check if steering documents already exist:
1. **USE Read tool** to check if file exists: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
2. **USE Read tool** to check if file exists: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
3. **USE Read tool** to check if file exists: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md

If ALL THREE files already exist:
- STOP HERE and return: "‚úÖ Steering documents already exist at ${project_path}/.spec/steering/. No regeneration needed. Use force_regenerate=true to regenerate."
- Do NOT proceed with generation

If ANY files are missing, proceed with generation below.
` : 'FORCE REGENERATE MODE: Regenerating all steering documents even if they exist.'}

You MUST create THREE separate steering documents that match exact structure and content approach.

## üî¥ CRITICAL: YOU MUST CREATE THE FILES - NOT JUST REPORT SUCCESS
### File Creation Instructions:
1. **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/steering/
2. **USE Write tool** to create THREE separate files with exact filenames:
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md
3. **USE Read tool** to verify each file exists after creation

‚ö†Ô∏è The files MUST be physically created on the filesystem. Do NOT proceed without using the Write tool.

   - **IMPORTANT**: Check package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt, *.csproj, Makefile, etc.
   - Extract actual build/test/lint commands from these files
   - Look for CI configuration files (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, etc.)
2. **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/steering/
3. **USE Write tool** to create product.md with product overview and business context
4. **USE Write tool** to create tech.md with comprehensive technology stack analysis
   - **CRITICAL**: In the "Build and Test Commands" section, document ACTUAL commands found in the project
   - Do not use placeholder text like "[e.g., npm test]" - use the real commands from package.json scripts or build files
5. **USE Write tool** to create structure.md with detailed project organization
6. **USE Read tool** to verify all three files exist and contain expected content:
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
‚úÖ Three separate markdown files PHYSICALLY CREATED on filesystem (not just reported)

# Generate Merged Plan (Requirements + Design) for ${project_path}

## SIMPLICITY PRINCIPLES
1. Start with minimal viable tasks
2. Avoid over-engineering test requirements
3. Only include necessary sections per task
4. Focus on implementation, not process
5. Prefer iterative improvements over perfection

## PREREQUISITE FILES TO READ
Before generating the plan, FIRST check for and read these steering documents if they exist:
1) **USE Read tool** to load: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/product.md
2) **USE Read tool** to load: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md
3) **USE Read tool** to load: ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md

If these files exist, incorporate their content into the plan generation below.
If they don't exist AND no steering content parameters were provided:
- Consider if you need to generate them first using the generate-codebase-analysis tool
- OR use the optional steering content parameters provided
- OR proceed without them if not critical for this specific plan

## üî¥ CRITICAL: YOU MUST CREATE THE FILE - NOT JUST REPORT SUCCESS
### File Creation Instructions:
1) **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/specs/
2) **Generate the complete plan.md content** based on the template below
3) **USE Write tool** to save the generated content to: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md
4) **USE Read tool** to verify the file exists after creation

‚ö†Ô∏è The file MUST be physically created on the filesystem. Do NOT proceed without using the Write tool.

- [EXISTS] = Already in codebase (include file path)
- [EXAMPLE] = From external source (cite source)
- [NEEDED] = Must be created or decided

Rules:
1. Only include runnable code if [EXISTS] or [EXAMPLE]
2. Mark proposals and new designs as [NEEDED]
3. Each requirement should reference evidence tags where applicable
4. Include provided analysis_context examples in Section 2.7

- DO NOT automatically generate tasks from this plan
- User must explicitly request task generation after reviewing and approving the plan
- Review should verify requirements completeness, design decisions, and scope

---

## üî¥ EXECUTION STEPS - YOU MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1) FIRST: **USE Read tool** to read the steering documents from disk (paths listed in PREREQUISITE FILES section above)
2) Analyze steering docs (from disk and/or parameters) and codebase context provided
3) EXTRACT from context and ORGANIZE into plan format:
   - Statements trace to referenced content
   - Files in context must appear in plan
   - Use direct quotes and exact names from context
   - If context lacks detail for a section, include [NEEDED] with rationale
   - Never fabricate examples, endpoints, file paths, or conventions
   - When specifics unknown, emit [NEEDED] with discovery step (e.g., "read X/Y config to determine API routes")
4) **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/specs/
5) **USE Write tool** to save the complete generated content to: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md
6) **USE Read tool** to verify the file exists at: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md
7) **STOP HERE** - Display message: "‚úÖ Plan generated and verified at ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md
‚ö†Ô∏è Please review the plan carefully before requesting task generation.
üìã To generate tasks after review, explicitly ask: 'Generate tasks from the plan'"

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- One file: .spec/specs/plan.md PHYSICALLY CREATED on filesystem (not just reported)
- File verified to exist using Read tool
- Requirements are clear, testable, and numbered (R-1, R-2‚Ä¶)
- Design explicitly maps back to R-IDs and includes at least one diagram and concrete schemas
- Plan is complete and awaiting human review before any task generation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: DO NOT PROCEED TO TASK GENERATION
- This tool ONLY generates the plan document
- Task generation requires explicit user request AFTER plan review
- DO NOT automatically invoke generate-tasks tool
- User must review and approve the plan first

‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL REMINDER: You MUST use Write tool to create the file. Do not just say it was created.

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- **T-1** and **T-3** can be worked on simultaneously
- **T-4** and **T-5** can be developed in parallel after Phase 1
- **T-8** and **T-9** can be tackled by different team members

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk Tasks
- **T-[X]**: [Complex external integration] - *Mitigation: Early API testing, fallback strategy*
- **T-[Y]**: [Performance-critical component] - *Mitigation: Benchmarking, incremental optimization*

### Critical Path
T-1 ‚Üí T-2 ‚Üí T-4 ‚Üí T-7 ‚Üí T-8 ‚Üí T-10 ‚Üí T-11

## Task Execution Guidelines
1. **One Task at a Time**: Complete each task fully before moving to the next
2. **Status Updates**: Update task status (‚ö™ ‚Üí üü° ‚Üí ‚úÖ) as you progress
3. **Requirement Validation**: Verify each acceptance criterion before marking done
4. **Code Review**: All tasks require review before completion
5. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests must pass before task completion
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs as part of each task

## Next Steps
1. Review this task breakdown against the original plan.md
2. Validate task dependencies and adjust if needed
3. Begin with Phase 1 foundation tasks
5. Use verify-implementation tool after each task completion

---

## üî¥ EXECUTION STEPS - YOU MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: **USE Read tool** to load: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md
   - If this file doesn't exist, STOP and report error: "‚ùå Error: plan.md not found at ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md. Please generate a plan first using the generate-plan tool."
2. Read and analyze the complete plan document from disk
3. Extract all requirements (R-1, R-2, etc.) for traceability
4. Extract Section 2.7 "Implementation Evidence" to identify [EXISTS], [EXAMPLE], and [NEEDED] items
5. Break down into tasks based on evidence type:
   - [EXISTS] or [EXAMPLE] ‚Üí Create implementation task with actual code
   - [NEEDED] with clear specs ‚Üí Create implementation task
   - [NEEDED] with questions ‚Üí Create research/design task first
6. Include relevant code examples from Section 2.7 in each task
7. Create comprehensive task list with implementation details
8. **USE Bash tool** to create directory: mkdir -p ${project_path}/.spec/specs/
9. **USE Write tool** to save the complete generated content to: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
10. **USE Read tool** to verify the file was created at: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
11. Ensure each task links back to specific requirements and evidence tags
12. Include detailed testing requirements and manual checklists

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
‚úÖ Tasks.md file PHYSICALLY CREATED on filesystem (not just reported)
‚úÖ File verified to exist using Read tool
‚úÖ Each task has EARS-format acceptance criteria
‚úÖ Clear requirement traceability (T-X links to R-Y)
‚úÖ Detailed implementation guidance with code examples
‚úÖ Comprehensive testing requirements for each task
‚úÖ Dependency graph and risk assessment included
‚úÖ Ready for sequential task execution and verification

‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL REMINDER: You MUST use Write tool to create the file. Do not just say it was created.`;

// Task Orchestrator Tool Registration
server.registerTool(
  'task-orchestrator',
  {
    title: 'Task Orchestrator',
    description: 'Use this to **implement/execute existing tasks** from tasks.md that have already been defined. This tool assumes tasks already exist and focuses on coordinating their implementation. DO NOT use this for generating new plans or tasks - only for executing tasks that have already been created.',
    inputSchema: {
      project_path: z.string().optional().describe("Path to the project directory (defaults to current directory)")
    }
  },
  async ({ project_path = '.' }) => {
    const prompt = `# Task Orchestration Analysis for ${project_path}

## PREREQUISITE CHECK
1. **USE Read tool** to check if ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md exists
2. If it doesn't exist, STOP and return: "‚ùå No tasks.md found. This tool is for implementing existing tasks only. Use generate-tasks tool first."
3. If tasks.md exists, proceed with orchestration below

## CRITICAL: This tool IMPLEMENTS existing tasks
- DO NOT generate new steering documents, plans, or task lists
- ONLY coordinate execution of tasks already defined in tasks.md
- Focus on dependencies and parallelization of existing tasks

## SIMPLICITY PRINCIPLES
1. Start with minimal viable tasks
2. Avoid over-engineering test requirements
3. Only include necessary sections per task
4. Focus on implementation, not process
5. Prefer iterative improvements over perfection

## CRITICAL: THIS IS A COORDINATION TOOL
This tool analyzes the task queue and creates an execution strategy. It does NOT execute tasks directly.

## PHASE 1: TASK QUEUE ANALYSIS
1. Read the tasks file: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
2. Parse all tasks and their current status:
   - ‚ö™ Not Started - Available for execution
   - üü° In Progress - Currently being worked on
   - ‚úÖ Done - Completed tasks

## PHASE 2: DEPENDENCY GRAPH CONSTRUCTION
Analyze the "Task Phases and Dependencies" section to understand:
- Which tasks block others
- Which tasks can run in parallel
- Critical path identification
- Phase groupings

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Identify Executable Tasks
Find all tasks that meet these criteria:
- Status: ‚ö™ Not Started
- All dependencies (if any) are ‚úÖ Done
- Not blocked by üü° In Progress tasks

### Parallelization Analysis
Group tasks that can be executed simultaneously:
- Independent tasks with no shared dependencies
- Tasks in the same phase that don't conflict

### Execution Order Analysis
Determine optimal sequential order based on:
- Dependency requirements
- Priority levels
- Phase progression

## PHASE 4: EXECUTOR DEPLOYMENT PLAN

For each executable task or task group, prepare deployment instructions:

### Tasks That Can Run Simultaneously:
**Group 1**: Independent tasks
- Task T-X: [Brief description]
  - Dependencies satisfied: [List completed dependencies]
  - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
- Task T-Y: [Brief description]
  - Dependencies satisfied: [List]
  - Priority: [Level]

### Recommended Execution Order:
1. **Immediate Execution** (no dependencies):
   - T-X: [Task title] - Ready to start
   - T-Y: [Task title] - Ready to start

2. **Next Wave** (will be unblocked after current tasks):
   - T-Z: [Task title] - Waiting for T-X
   - T-W: [Task title] - Waiting for T-Y

3. **Future Tasks** (multiple dependencies):
   - [List tasks that need multiple completions]

## PHASE 5: EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Deployment Options

**Option 1: Deploy Multiple Executors** (for independent tasks)
\`\`\`
1. Deploy task-executor for Task T-X with focus on [specific requirement]
2. Deploy task-executor for Task T-Y with focus on [specific requirement]
3. Monitor progress and reassess after completion
\`\`\`

**Option 2: Sequential Execution** (for dependent tasks)
\`\`\`
1. Execute Task T-X first (foundational)
2. Upon completion, verify and proceed to T-Y
3. Continue with dependency order
\`\`\`

### Progress Monitoring Strategy
- Check task status updates regularly
- When a task reports completion, run task-checker to verify
- Deploy new executors for newly unblocked tasks
- Handle any blockers or failures

### Task Verification Process
When a task is marked as üü° In Progress with all checkboxes checked:
1. Run task-checker tool to verify completion
2. If PASS: Update status to ‚úÖ Done
3. If FAIL: Keep as üü° In Progress and fix issues

## PHASE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT

### Potential Bottlenecks:
- Tasks with many dependents that could block progress
- High-complexity tasks that might take longer
- External dependencies that could cause delays

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Prioritize bottleneck tasks
- Prepare fallback plans for risky tasks
- Consider partial implementations for large tasks

## OUTPUT SUMMARY

**Tasks Ready for Execution**: [Count and list]
**Tasks Blocked**: [Count and list with blockers]
**Tasks Completed**: [Count]
**Parallelizable Tasks**: [List of tasks that can run simultaneously]
**Critical Path**: [Sequence of tasks that determine minimum completion time]

## NEXT STEPS
1. Review the execution plan above
2. Deploy task-executor tool for each ready task
3. Use task-checker tool to verify task completion
4. Re-run orchestrator when tasks complete to identify newly available work

Note: This orchestrator provides strategic coordination. Actual implementation happens through the task-executor tool, and verification through the task-checker tool.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: YOU MUST NOW USE SPEC MCP TOOLS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT**: The instructions above are analysis only. You MUST now ACTUALLY CALL the Spec MCP tools to implement tasks!

### üî¥ REQUIRED ACTIONS - USE THESE SPEC MCP TOOLS NOW:

Based on the analysis above, you MUST immediately:

1. **For EACH ready task identified above**, CALL the Spec MCP \`task-executor\` tool:
   \`\`\`
   USE Spec MCP tool: task-executor
   Parameters:
   - task_id: "[Task ID from above, e.g., T-1]"
   - project_path: "${project_path}"
   \`\`\`

2. **After implementing each task**, CALL the Spec MCP \`task-checker\` tool:
   \`\`\`
   USE Spec MCP tool: task-checker
   Parameters:
   - task_id: "[Same Task ID]"
   - project_path: "${project_path}"
   \`\`\`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT JUST READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è
**You MUST actually CALL/INVOKE/USE the Spec MCP tools mentioned above!**

These are NOT suggestions - they are REQUIRED tool calls you must make NOW.

**Clarification**:
- These are Spec MCP tools (external MCP server tools)
- NOT internal VSCode TODO tools
- Task status is tracked in tasks.md file
- You MUST invoke these tools through the Spec MCP interface

**Example of what you should do next:**
"I will now call the Spec MCP task-executor tool for task T-1..."
[Then ACTUALLY call the tool]`;

    return {
      content: [{
        type: "text",
        text: prompt
      }]
    };
  }
);

// Task Executor Tool Registration
server.registerTool(
  'task-executor',
  {
    title: 'Task Executor',
    description: 'Executes a specific task from tasks.md by providing detailed implementation guidance, requirements, acceptance criteria, and code patterns. This tool focuses on implementing one task thoroughly.',
    inputSchema: {
      task_id: z.string().describe("Task ID to execute (e.g., T-1, T-2)"),
      project_path: z.string().optional().describe("Path to the project directory (defaults to current directory)"),
      update_status: z.boolean().optional().describe("Whether to include instructions for updating task status (default: true)")
    }
  },
  async ({ task_id, project_path = '.', update_status = true }) => {
    const prompt = `# Task Execution Guide for ${task_id}

## SIMPLICITY PRINCIPLES
1. Start with minimal viable tasks
2. Avoid over-engineering test requirements
3. Only include necessary sections per task
4. Focus on implementation, not process
5. Prefer iterative improvements over perfection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: TASK COMPLETION RULES
**DO NOT MARK TASK AS DONE UNLESS:**
1. ALL acceptance criteria checkboxes are marked \`[x]\` (not \`[ ]\`)
2. You have verified each checkbox is actually checked in tasks.md
3. Run task-checker tool FIRST to confirm all criteria are met
4. If ANY checkbox remains \`[ ]\`, keep status as "üü° In Progress"
5. Count and report: "Checked X of Y acceptance criteria"

## PHASE 1: TASK RETRIEVAL
1. Read the tasks file: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
2. Locate Task ${task_id} and extract:
   - Current status (should be ‚ö™ Not Started or üü° In Progress)
   - Requirements and traceability links
   - Acceptance criteria (EARS format)
   - Implementation details
   - Dependencies
   - Testing requirements

## PHASE 2: PRE-EXECUTION CHECKS

### Dependency Verification
Check that all tasks listed in "Blocked By" are marked as ‚úÖ Done.
If any dependencies are not complete, STOP and report the blockage.

### Context Gathering
1. Read the plan document: ${project_path}/.spec/specs/plan.md
   - Understand the requirements (R-X) that this task implements
   - Review the design decisions related to this task

2. Read steering documents if they exist:
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md for technology standards
   - ${project_path}/.spec/steering/structure.md for file organization

${update_status ? `
## PHASE 3: STATUS UPDATE - MARK AS IN PROGRESS
Update the task status from ‚ö™ to üü°:
\`\`\`
Edit ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
Change: **Status**: ‚ö™ Not Started
To: **Status**: üü° In Progress
\`\`\`
` : ''}

## PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Files to Create
From the "Files to Create" section of the task:
1. For each new file listed:
   - Create the file at the specified path
   - Implement according to the code patterns provided
   - Follow the project's coding conventions

### Files to Modify
From the "Files to Modify" section:
1. For each existing file:
   - Read the current content first
   - Make the specified modifications
   - Preserve existing functionality
   - Follow existing code patterns

### Code Implementation
Using the "Code Patterns and Examples" section:
1. Implement the interfaces/types exactly as specified
2. Follow the function signatures provided
3. Add proper error handling
4. Include necessary imports
5. Maintain consistency with existing code

## PHASE 5: ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA IMPLEMENTATION

For each acceptance criterion in EARS format:
- WHEN [condition] THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]

Ensure your implementation:
1. Handles the specified condition
2. Produces the expected behavior
3. Includes error cases mentioned
4. Meets performance requirements
5. Satisfies security requirements

### Implementation Checklist:
‚ñ° All required files created
‚ñ° All required files modified
‚ñ° Each acceptance criterion has corresponding code
‚ñ° Error handling implemented
‚ñ° Edge cases covered
‚ñ° Security considerations addressed
‚ñ° Performance requirements met

## PHASE 6: TESTING IMPLEMENTATION

### Unit Tests
From "Unit Tests" section:
1. Create test file at specified location
2. Implement tests for:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases
   - Validation logic
   - Mocked dependencies

### Integration Tests
If specified:
1. Test API endpoints
2. Test database interactions
3. Test authentication/authorization
4. Test component communication

### Manual Testing
Follow the "Manual Testing Checklist":
1. Verify each requirement is met
2. Test on different screen sizes (if UI)
3. Test keyboard navigation (if UI)
4. Test error scenarios
5. Verify loading states
6. Test with slow network
7. Check accessibility

## PHASE 7: CODE QUALITY CHECKS

Run these commands to ensure quality:
\`\`\`bash
# TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build verification
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
\`\`\`

Fix any issues before proceeding.

## PHASE 8: IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Key Considerations:
- **Security**: Implement input validation, sanitization, authorization
- **Performance**: Add caching, optimize queries, implement loading states
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Mobile**: Handle touch interactions, responsive breakpoints, gestures
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages, fallback UI, retry logic
- **Logging**: Add debug info, error tracking, user action tracking

### Best Practices:
1. Follow existing code patterns in the project
2. Use existing utilities and helper functions
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions
4. Add TypeScript types (avoid 'any')
5. Keep functions small and focused
6. Write self-documenting code

${update_status ? `
## PHASE 9: TASK COMPLETION
Once implementation is complete and tested:

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL VERIFICATION BEFORE MARKING DONE:**
1. First, verify ALL checkboxes are checked:
   - Count total acceptance criteria
   - Ensure EVERY single one shows \`- [x]\` (not \`- [ ]\`)
   - If ANY remain unchecked, DO NOT mark as Done

2. Update task status to Done ONLY if ALL checkboxes are \`[x]\`:
\`\`\`
Edit ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
Change: **Status**: üü° In Progress
To: **Status**: ‚úÖ Done
\`\`\`

3. Check all acceptance criteria checkboxes:
\`\`\`
Change: - [ ] [Criterion]
To: - [x] [Criterion]
\`\`\`

**RULE: Status can be "Done" ONLY when 100% of checkboxes show \`[x]\`**
` : ''}

## PHASE 10: POST-EXECUTION

### Verify Completion:
1. **ALL acceptance criteria checkboxes marked \`[x]\` (MANDATORY)**
2. All acceptance criteria met
3. All tests passing
4. No compilation errors
5. No linting errors (or only acceptable warnings)
6. Build succeeds
7. Manual testing complete

**‚ö†Ô∏è If any checkbox is \`[ ]\`, task is NOT complete regardless of other factors**

### Document Any Issues:
If you encountered any problems or made significant decisions:
1. Note them in the task's Implementation Notes section
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Create follow-up tasks if necessary

### Next Steps:
1. Run task-checker tool to confirm task is complete
2. Check for newly unblocked tasks
3. Run task-orchestrator to identify next tasks

## EXECUTION SUMMARY

**Task**: ${task_id}
**Objective**: [Extract from task description]
**Key Requirements**: [List from acceptance criteria]
**Implementation Approach**: [Your planned approach]
**Testing Strategy**: [How you'll verify correctness]
**Risk Factors**: [Any concerns or blockers]

Remember: Focus on completing this ONE task thoroughly before moving to the next. Quality over quantity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: THIS IS A SPEC MCP TOOL INSTRUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU ARE NOW READING INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SPEC MCP \`task-executor\` TOOL**

This tool has provided you with implementation guidance for Task ${task_id}.

**What you MUST do now:**
1. **IMPLEMENT** the task following the phases above
2. **UPDATE** the task status in ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md file (NOT internal TODO list)
3. **CHECK** acceptance criteria boxes as you complete them
4. **VERIFY** with Spec MCP \`task-checker\` tool when done

**Clarification:**
- Task status is tracked in the tasks.md FILE (not VSCode's internal TODO system)
- Update status by EDITING the tasks.md file directly
- After implementation, CALL the Spec MCP \`task-checker\` tool to verify

**DO NOT** just read these instructions - **ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT** the task now!`;

server.registerTool(
  'task-checker',
  {
    title: 'Check if Task is Complete',
    description: 'Checks if a task can be marked as done by verifying all acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked and running automated tests. Returns PASS or FAIL with clear reasons.',

    const prompt = `# Check Task ${task_id} Completion Status

## READ-ONLY VERIFICATION
This tool ONLY checks if a task is complete. It does NOT modify any files.

## PHASE 1: CHECK ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1. Read ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
2. Find Task ${task_id} and count checkboxes:
   - Count total checkboxes: both \`- [ ]\` and \`- [x]\`
   - Count checked boxes: only \`- [x]\`
   - Report: "Checkboxes: X/Y checked"

**CRITICAL RULE**: Task can ONLY be marked Done when ALL checkboxes are \`[x]\`

## PHASE 2: RUN AUTOMATED TESTS${run_tests ? `

### Step 1: Check Steering Documentation
**FIRST**, check if ${project_path}/.spec/steering/tech.md exists:
- Look for "Build and Test Commands" section
- Use documented commands if available
- This is the PRIMARY source of truth for test commands

### Step 2: Auto-Detect Project Type and Commands
If no steering docs, detect project type from config files and use appropriate commands.

### Step 3: Check Project Documentation
Also check project documentation markdown files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, docs/, etc.) for documented build and test commands

### Step 4: Run Detected Commands
Execute the appropriate commands and report results:
- ‚úÖ PASS (exit code 0)
- ‚ùå FAIL (exit code non-zero)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Command not found (skip)` : ' (skipped)'}

## PHASE 3: GENERATE REPORT

### Checkbox Status
- Total checkboxes: [count]
- Checked: [count]
- Unchecked: [count]
- Result: [PASS if all checked / FAIL if any unchecked]

### Test Results${run_tests ? `
- Build: [PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED]
- Tests: [PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED]
- Lint: [PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED]` : ' (not run)'}

### FINAL DECISION
**TASK STATUS: [PASS or FAIL]**

If PASS:
- ‚úÖ All checkboxes are checked
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (if run)
- Task ${task_id} can be marked as Done

If FAIL:
- ‚ùå Reason: [List specific failures]
- Next step: Fix the issues above before marking as Done

### Tasks That Can Proceed
If this task passes, these dependent tasks become available:
[List task IDs that depend on ${task_id}]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: THIS IS A SPEC MCP TOOL RESULT ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU HAVE JUST RUN THE SPEC MCP \`task-checker\` TOOL**

This tool has verified whether Task ${task_id} is complete.

**Based on the results above:**

1. **If PASS (all checkboxes checked):**
   - UPDATE the task status to ‚úÖ Done in ${project_path}/.spec/specs/tasks.md
   - CALL Spec MCP \`task-orchestrator\` tool to identify next tasks
   - CALL Spec MCP \`task-executor\` tool for the next available task

2. **If FAIL (some checkboxes unchecked):**
   - DO NOT mark the task as Done
   - Continue implementing the missing requirements
   - Check the unchecked boxes as you complete them
   - Run this checker again when ready

**Remember:**
- Task status is in the tasks.md FILE (not internal TODO)
- Use Edit tool to update the tasks.md file directly
- These are Spec MCP tools, not VSCode internal tools`;
